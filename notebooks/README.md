# Notebooks

This subdirectory include Jupyter notebooks for my blog.

## How to run

The easiest is to have `nix` installed:

```sh
nix develop -c uv run jupyter lab
```

Alternatively, you can install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Then run:

```sh
uv run jupyter lab
```
